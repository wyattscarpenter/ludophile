These files are not original to the Ludophile distributable, and are just things I keep around here for my convenience in maintaining the project. DO NOT look at these file unless you have already beaten the game (or don't care). In fact, there's little reason for you to look at these files even once you have beaten the game.

Jack Lance presumably had some software, some scripts or something, that he used to generate the directory structure of the game. But I don't have those. I just have what I've made myself.
