You get this password from Bill, the bug. It is in the file key.txt. The idea here is that you play with the margins of key.txt to get it to wrap the text in various ways, narrower and narrower, and this causes the characters in the text file to fall into the shapes of digits. 4, then 3, then 6, then 2. It's a remarkable little trick!

You then use this password on the encrypted pdf The Crypt.pdf, which you find on the outskirts of town, and instantly win the game. (That was remarkably easy!)
