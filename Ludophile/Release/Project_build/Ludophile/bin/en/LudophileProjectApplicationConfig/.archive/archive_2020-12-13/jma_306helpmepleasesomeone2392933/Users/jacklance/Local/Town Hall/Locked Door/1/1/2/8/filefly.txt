"Hello.
I'm in distress at the moment as my husband and the mayor of this town is nowhere to be found!
He is a bug, like me, so he's quite small which sometimes make it hard for him to find.
He went outside Filadelphia yesterday, and I haven't heard from since.
I'm just so worried something might have happened! Can you help me to find him?
I'd be eternally grateful!"
