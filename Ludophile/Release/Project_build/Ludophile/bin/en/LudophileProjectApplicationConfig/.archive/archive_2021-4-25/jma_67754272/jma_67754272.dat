Have you talked to him lately? It seems like something strange is going on, but I'm on a time crunch trying to make this game in time, so I really don't have time to go to his house or anything.

We were both pretty excited to play it, but the dude's computer is seriously messed up. I don't know what's wrong with his file organization but he couldn't seem to find anything.
He seemed really embarassed about how long it took him to find Steam, and said he was going to go through everything and sort it all out that weekend. Haven't heard from at all since then.
