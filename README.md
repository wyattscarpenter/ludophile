# ludophile
A preservation and light "remaster" of Jack Lance's Ludophile.

This readme is by me, not Jack Lance, and is original to my preservation project.

The preserved project is still Jack Lance's intellectual property, and is presumably proprietary and now belongs, I suppose, to his next of kin.

At the moment, 2025-10-11, you can visit https://jacklance.itch.io/ludophile and see a page that is more or less the following:

```
Ludophile

click on ludophile.exe to play

unzipping might fail if you dont use winrar... computers are weird.

From that website, you can download a zip, which file has a sha1hash of TODO and a git hash of TODO. I've unzipped the zip for you already, no winrar needed! It's the Ludophile/ folder now.

Sadly, yes, nqh in the comments above is right: in the original Ludophile the shortcuts (lnk files) don't work, and keep trying to take you to the Documents folder instead. So, I decided to fix them, because git supports symlinks (if your operating system does) and Jack Lance isn't around anymore to fix it himself. RIP @[JackLance](https://github.com/JackLance/).

I think it's a pretty good game.

Without further ado, enter the Ludophile folder and click on ludophile.exe to play.
